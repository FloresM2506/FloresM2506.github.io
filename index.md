# Marisa Flores' Portfolio

My name is Marisa Flores, and I am currently a freshman pursuing a major in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton. I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge in programming, algorithms, and data structures to graduate in 2027. Beyond my academic endeavors, I find immense joy in actively participating in extracurricular activities around environmental justice. As well as a community contributor, I am deeply invested in creating positive change within my university and the broader community. One of my key interests lies in establishing environmentally friendly practices and resources that contribute to a sustainable future.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1:

    This lab aims to acquaint you with the Linux system, BASH shell, and GitHub, providing hands-on experience. During the session, you will compile and run a basic "hello world" program. This practical exposure is essential for developing proficiency in fundamental tools crucial for computer science, fostering a solid foundation for future coding endeavors.

* Lab 4, Part 2:

    This program serves as an initial iteration of a high/low guessing game, where Player One selects a secret number, and Player Two attempts to guess it. The implementation involves designing the game logic, incorporating hints for incorrect guesses, and concluding with a decisive outcome. The absence of a predefined algorithm challenges you and your partner to employ if statements, fostering problem-solving skills and encouraging trial and error a valuable exercise for aspiring programmers. This hands-on experience not only fulfills specific printing requirements, such as prompts and outcome messages but also encourages autonomy in program design. The simplicity of the game in this stage provides an enjoyable platform for collaborative learning, emphasizing the importance of practical, self-directed coding exercises in the development of programming skills.

* Lab 9, Part 1:

    In this programming task, the focus was on crafting a function capable of calculating the average mean of a vector, excluding the minimum and maximum elements. By undertaking this challenge, you honed your skills in algorithmic design and gained a deeper understanding of vector manipulation. This exercise is pivotal as it not only reinforces the concept of averaging within a coding context but also promotes problem-solving proficiency, a critical skill for tackling complex computational challenges in various domains.
