## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1:

    This lab aims to acquaint you with the Linux system, BASH shell, and GitHub, providing hands-on experience. During the session, you will compile and run a basic "hello world" program. I enjoyed this lab because it was a practical exposure that is essential for developing proficiency in fundamental tools crucial for computer science, fostering a solid foundation for future coding endeavors.

* Lab 4, Part 2:

    This program serves as an initial iteration of a high/low guessing game, where Player One selects a secret number, and Player Two attempts to guess it. The implementation involves designing the game logic, incorporating hints for incorrect guesses, and concluding with a decisive outcome. The absence of a predefined algorithm challenges you and your partner to employ if statements, fostering problem-solving skills and encouraging trial and errorâ€”a valuable exercise for aspiring programmers. I enjoyed this lab because it was a hands-on experience that not only fulfills specific printing requirements, such as prompts and outcome messages but also encourages autonomy in program design. As well as the simplicity of the game, this stage provides an enjoyable platform for collaborative learning, emphasizing the importance of practical, self-directed coding exercises in the development of programming skills.

* Lab 9, Part 1:

    In this programming task, the focus was on crafting a function capable of calculating the average mean of a vector, excluding the minimum and maximum elements. I enjoyed lab 9, part 1 because by undertaking this challenge, you honed in on your skills in algorithmic design and gained a deeper understanding of vector manipulation. It also was pivotal in not only reinforcing the concept of averaging within a coding context but also promoting problem-solving proficiency, a critical skill for tackling complex computational challenges in various domains.
